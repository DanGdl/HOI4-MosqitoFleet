 ENG_early_destroyer: "V/W Class"
 ENG_early_destroyer_desc: "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 ENG_basic_destroyer: "G/H/I Class"
 ENG_basic_destroyer_desc: "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs.

These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SAF_improved_destroyer: "J/K/N Class"
 SAF_improved_destroyer_desc: "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 SAF_advanced_destroyer: "Battle Class"
 SAF_advanced_destroyer_desc: "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SIA_early_destroyer: "Phra Ruang Class"
 SIA_early_destroyer_desc: "The Phra Ruang was a former British R-class destroyer that was sold to The Royal Thai Navy in 1920. The ship displaced just over 1,000 tons and was armed with three 120mm/45 QF Mk IV guns and four 533mm torpedo tubes. They had good speed, range, and reliability for their vintage."

It displaced over 1,400 tons and was armed with four 120mm/45 Krupp QF guns. It had a strong AA complement and two 450mm torpedo tubes. Given their vintage and large size, they were fairly slow compared to other destroyers."
 VIC_early_destroyer: "Bourrasque Class"
 VIC_early_destroyer_desc: "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament was smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 VIC_basic_destroyer: "Le Fantasque Class"
 VIC_basic_destroyer_desc: "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 VIC_improved_destroyer: "L'Intrépide Class"
 VIC_improved_destroyer_desc: "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers were a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, with an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons and larger engines."
 VIC_advanced_destroyer: "Hoche Class"
 VIC_advanced_destroyer_desc: "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 YUG_early_destroyer: "Dubrovnik Class"
 YUG_early_destroyer_desc: "The Dubrovnik destroyer was the largest ship in the Yugoslav fleet at the time of its purchase. The ship was built in the U.K. and delivered to Yugoslavia in 1932.

 advanced_battleship: "Battleship IV"
 early_battleship_desc: "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 basic_battleship_desc: "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 improved_battleship_desc: "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 advanced_battleship_desc: "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."
 SH_early_battleship: "Super-Heavy Battleship I"
 SH_basic_battleship: "Super-Heavy Battleship II"
 SH_early_battleship_desc: "The current state of the world no longer has any room for abiding by naval treaties. Without these limitations, we can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 SH_basic_battleship_desc: "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."
 ENG_early_battleship:1 "Revenge Class"
 ENG_early_battleship_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 ENG_basic_battleship: "King George V Class"
 ENG_basic_battleship_desc: "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 ENG_improved_battleship: "Lion Class"
 ENG_improved_battleship_desc: "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 ENG_advanced_battleship: "Vanguard Class"
 ENG_advanced_battleship_desc: "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 ENG_SH_early_battleship: "Centurion Class"
 ENG_SH_early_battleship_desc: "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 ENG_SH_basic_battleship: "Lion II Class"
 ENG_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 FRA_early_battleship: "Courbet Class"
 FRA_early_battleship_desc: "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 FRA_basic_battleship: "Richelieu Class"
 FRA_basic_battleship_desc: "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRA_improved_battleship: "Gascogne Class"
 FRA_improved_battleship_desc: "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FRA_advanced_battleship: "Alsace Class"
 FRA_advanced_battleship_desc: "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 FRA_SH_early_battleship: "Charlemagne Class"
 FRA_SH_early_battleship_desc: "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 FRA_SH_basic_battleship: "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 FRA_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 GER_early_battleship: "Deutschland Class"
 GER_early_battleship_desc: "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 GER_basic_battleship: "Scharnhorst Class"
 GER_basic_battleship_desc: "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 GER_improved_battleship: "Bismarck Class"
 GER_improved_battleship_desc: "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 GER_advanced_battleship: "Hindenburg Class"
 GER_advanced_battleship_desc: "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."
 GER_SH_early_battleship: "Schlachtschiff H41"
 GER_SH_early_battleship_desc: "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 GER_SH_basic_battleship: "Schlachtschiff H44"
 GER_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20") guns."
 ITA_early_battleship: "Conte Di Cavour Class"
 ITA_early_battleship_desc: "The Conte Di Cavour class battleships were commissioned during World War I. They had 305mm Armstrong-Vickers guns, displaced 23,000 tons, and had a top speed comparable to other dreadnought-era battleships. Starting in 1933, the two remaining ships of the class underwent a serious redesign, improving their size, armament, and performance to be on par with the emerging 'fast' battleships of the time."
 ITA_basic_battleship: "Caio Duilio Class"
 ITA_basic_battleship_desc: "The Caio Duilio class of battleships were originally commissioned at the start of World War I. Both ships, however, underwent a complete redesign between 1937 and 1940. This model represents the redesign. The armament is upgraded to ten 320mm M1934 guns, the displacement is now 29,000 tons, and the speed is enough to classify them as a 'fast' battleship. "
 ITA_improved_battleship: "Littorio Class"
 ITA_improved_battleship_desc: "The Littorio class, also known as the Vittorio Veneto class, represented the most modern battleships used by Italy during World War II. They displaced over 40,000 tons and were very fast for their size. They formed the backbone of the Italian fleet."
 ITA_advanced_battleship: "Impero Class"
 ITA_advanced_battleship_desc: "The Impero battleships were a hypothetical class of late-war battleships. They displaced about 43,000 tons, were armed with 381mm Ansaldo guns, and were well-armored."
 ITA_SH_early_battleship: "Regina Margherita Class"
 ITA_SH_early_battleship_desc: "The Regina Margherita class is a hypothetical class of heavy battleships that would have been launched shortly before the start of the war. They would be comparable to the Japanese Yamato class battleships. They would be very well-armored, displace about 60,000 tons, and be armed with 406mm guns."
 ITA_SH_basic_battleship: "Regina Elena Class"
 ITA_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The Regina Elena class is a hypothetical class of heavy battleships that would be launched around the time of Italy's entry into the war. They were comparable to the Montana class battleships planned by the U.S. They were highly armored, displaced over 70,000 tons, and were armed with 406mm guns in their main battery."
 JAP_early_battleship: "Fuso Class"
 JAP_early_battleship_desc: "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernized in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armored and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centerline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry."
 JAP_basic_battleship: "Kongo Class"
 JAP_basic_battleship_desc: "The Kongo battleships were built for the IJN just before World War I as battlecruisers, but were heavily modernized in the late 1930s and reclassified as first rate fast battleships. Their armor, guns and engines were all drastically upgraded and the Kongos emerged as the fastest Japanese battleships of the war."
 JAP_improved_battleship: "Tajima Class"
 JAP_improved_battleship_desc: "The Tajima class was a hypothetical class of fast battleships, designed to be cheaper and faster to build than the massive Yamato class battleships. They utilized the older cannons of previous battleships, but high speed, adequate armor and AA provided the defense for these ships."
 JAP_advanced_battleship: "Iwami Class"
 JAP_advanced_battleship_desc: "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilized new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
 JAP_SH_early_battleship: "Yamato Class"
 JAP_SH_early_battleship_desc: "The Yamato class consisted of the heaviest battleships ever created, displacing 72,000 tons, and the ships were designed to be the pride and might of the Japanese navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship."
 JAP_SH_basic_battleship: "Super Yamato Class"
 JAP_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armor thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
 SOV_early_battleship: "Marat Class"
 SOV_early_battleship_desc: "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 SOV_basic_battleship: "Project 21"
 SOV_basic_battleship_desc: "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 SOV_improved_battleship: "Lenin class"
 SOV_improved_battleship_desc: "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 SOV_advanced_battleship: "Stalingrad Class"
 SOV_advanced_battleship_desc: "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 SOV_SH_early_battleship: "Sovetsky Soyuz Class"
 SOV_SH_early_battleship_desc: "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 SOV_SH_basic_battleship: "Project 23bis"
 SOV_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 USA_early_battleship: "New York Class"
 USA_early_battleship_desc: "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor."
 USA_basic_battleship: "North Carolina Class"
 USA_basic_battleship_desc: "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
 USA_improved_battleship: "Iowa Class"
 USA_improved_battleship_desc: "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
 USA_advanced_battleship: "Illinois Class"
 USA_advanced_battleship_desc: "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 USA_SH_early_battleship: "Virginia Class"
 USA_SH_early_battleship_desc: "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
 USA_SH_basic_battleship: "Montana Class"
 USA_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."

 ARG_early_battleship_desc: "The Rivadavia-class was a pair of U.S.-built dreadnought battleships built for the Argentine navy in the early 1910s. They displaced 27,500 tons and were armed with twelve 305mm/50 call cannon as their main guns. They remained in service until the 1950s."
 AST_early_battleship:1 "Revenge Class"
 AST_early_battleship_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 AST_basic_battleship: "King George V Class"
 AST_basic_battleship_desc: "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_improved_battleship: "Lion Class"
 AST_improved_battleship_desc: "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_advanced_battleship: "Vanguard Class"
 AST_advanced_battleship_desc: "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 AST_SH_early_battleship: "Centurion Class"
 AST_SH_early_battleship_desc: "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 AST_SH_basic_battleship: "Lion II Class"
 AST_SH_basic_battleship_desc: "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
